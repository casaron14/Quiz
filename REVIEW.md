# Deployment Review Checklist

| `api/validate.js` | New endpoint for end-of-quiz validation before submission | ✅ |
| `api/leaderboard.js` | No changes needed (reads shared state) | ✅ |

## Config & Documentation

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|

## Security & State

- ✅ Admin password now required for both GET (with `?admin=1`) and POST
- ✅ Correct answers never sent to client
- ✅ Server validates all submissions server-side
- ✅ Quiz state object is stable (mutations instead of reassignments)
- ⚠️ State is still in-memory (resets on cold starts; noted in docs)

## Ready for push?

All changes are consistent with 5-winner limit and end-of-quiz validation flow. No breaking conflicts detected.
